    go with the flow

a damn nice quote from Eric Brechner’s [I. M. Wright "Hard
Code"](http://blogs.msdn.com/eric_brechner/archive/2005/09/01/September-1-2005-go-with-the-flow-retention-and-turnover.aspx)
blog regarding team dynamics, specifically about retaining people:

> \[...\] the best way to deal with turnover is to expect it and embrace
> it. How? Think flow, flow, floooooooow.

> Think of your team as a river instead of a lake. A lake stagnates.
> Thereâ€™s no energy or impetus to change. The same is true of groups
> that stagnate. They cultivate mediocrity and complacency; they abhor
> risk. A river is always running and changing with lots of great
> energy. You want a river.

a nice metaphor and it strikes a chord – building an ideal team is one
thing, but perhaps it is more about building a self-sustaining culture
when individuals might be coming and going. the latter seems to be a
more important goal in the long run.
