still a little buggy (imports, navigation, dealing with large
subscriptions), but full of ajaxian goodness

-   has labels (no more bloglines cludgy hierarchies)
-   search (will work at some point i hope)
-   stars to mark interesting content
-   filters
-   quick sorts by relevance/date
-   no mousewheel scrolling (keyboard paging is a bit unnatural); i find
    myself trying to take the list of feeds and drag it
-   shortcuts (they mimic *vi* - what a nice twist)
-   it would be nice if i could point to the opml link, as opposed to
    saving it to a file first and then importing it
-   i miss the social aspect of bloglines - the popularity of the feed
    by readers and the actual list of readers that subscribe to the feed
    (not to mention recommendations)
-   when [google feedfetcher](http://www.google.com/feedfetcher.html)
    accesses the feed, it does not show the number of subscriptions in
    the user-agent string like bloglines does

in the end it will take a while to get used to it; there is a barrier
for entry with the way everything is organized - it is a step up from
simplicity of bloglines and others that had a simple model of entries
under individual feeds that in turn could be grouped. most of my feeds
are tied to personalities - it is not a uniform sea of posts. on the
other hand there are some long overdue features that bloglines lacks.

the overall experience at this point could be nicely summarized by
"clunky" - the interface and the responsiveness. i have no desire to
switch from bloglines at least for a while. hopefully this will spark
some healthy competition.
