    biling the night away
---

working operations issues on sunday night is never much fun. especially
when you are talking to a certified oracle admin/dba/etc at work, and
you tell him "i am trying to telnet to the port the database is
listening on and nothing responds", and he keeps telling you that one
cannot telnet to that box. then he insists that the only way to connect
to the port is using oracle client. and then i notice that the guy's
phone work number ends with 1337. oh the irony!
