        -   realize that there is a new version of a blogging tool
            -   start upgrading blogging tool in test in vmware instance
                -   realize that new vmware server is out
                    -   upgrade vmware
                        -   upgrade vmware tools (never easy!)

                -   upgrade web server while at it
            -   screw around with formatting on the upgraded blog
                platform
                -   fail to get pagination to work (like i fail every

                                        -   no, no, no! there lies
                                            madness!
                                            -   `stack overflow`!
