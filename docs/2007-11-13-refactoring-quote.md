great quote from [ward
cunningham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham) in response to
[steve mcconnell’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McConnell) [post
on technical
debt](http://blogs.construx.com/blogs/stevemcc/archive/2007/11/01/technical-debt-2.aspx):

> I would also sometimes explain refactoring to my management as
> follows: “We tried to add the feature to our application but found
> that there was no place for it. So we first made a place, and then
> added the feature there.”
