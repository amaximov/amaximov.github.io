jive software
"[clearspace](http://www.jivesoftware.com/products/clearspace/ "clearspace")"
finally went beta, and is available for download.

first i came into contact with these guys through [their IM server
product](http://www.jivesoftware.com/products/im/ "wildfire IM server").
for an open-source tool it was surprisingly polished, had all the
"enterprise" features i needed (flexible AD integration with a
possibility of using multiple auth providers, TLS, gates to other IM
systems), was self-contained for easy trial; it was stable (running on
UX for almost a year without restarts), and scaled just fine for
hundreds of users (after a gratifyingly viral adoption). also there was
that intagible feeling that everything was just done right - directory
structure made sense, startup was just as expected, it was built on
familiar components - over time i came to trust these guys as competent
developers that would not go astray in some pseudo-academic delusion, or
succumb to ADD and play with some new tech of the day
([snipsnap](http://snipsnap.org/ "snipsnap"), anyone?).

i kept an eye on [their
blog](http://www.jivesoftware.com/blog/ "jive software blog") ever since
the initial announcement of "clearspace" product. it seems to address
exactly the stuff i have been talking about for years - no stunning
revelations, just a simple clean integration of IM/blogs/wiki/document
management/forums/emails in an enterprise-friendly format that puts them
all in context. this is not a slapped together CMS monster or behemoth
of a sharepoint, but a collaboration tool that pulls together sensible
implementations of all these existing forms of communication. this is
something i talked about in an [old school paper of
mine](http://body.splitbody.com/wiki/body/space/school/capstone/topics/collaborative+tools+for+software+development/paper.pdf "old school paper on collaborative tools");
i also briefly talked about it
[here](/articles/2006/09/04/why-wiki "why wiki?") and
[here](/articles/2006/12/17/why-wiki-continued "why wiki? continued").

we'll see if the product actually does all this stuff, but i would
definitely dedicate some time to playing with it.
