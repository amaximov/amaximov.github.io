    insider's view on outsourcing
---

i am a semi-regular reader of the [codecraft
blog](http://www.journalhome.com/codecraft/) (and highly recommend it).
in [one of the recent
posts](http://www.journalhome.com/codecraft/13920/) he talks at length
about the software market in india, the hiring practices, the challenges - all from a viewpoint of someone that is currently involved in it.
don't skip the comments - they are a great read as well.

although my experience with outsourcing is very limited (only recently i
got involved in a project that has a significant outsourcing component),
a lot of the points raised ring true.

[this follow-up
entry](http://ravimohan.blogspot.com/2005/10/iit-grad-excellent-programmer.html)
by one of those who commented in codecraft's blog is also worth reading.
