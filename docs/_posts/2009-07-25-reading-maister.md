[managing the professional services
firm](http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Professional-Service-David-Maister/dp/0684834316/)
is my second book on consulting (first one being weinberg’s [secrets of
consulting](http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Consulting-Giving-Getting-Successfully/dp/0932633013/)).

i have been resisting the temptation to gobble up the whole book in one
sitting. i am taking it slowly, giving myself time to think through each
chapter, since every one is loaded with so much insight and relevant
quotes, that at times i even get frustrated, not able to take it all in.

it has it all – from marketing to clients, finding work, to running a
consulting business, motivating and growing people. i am only half-way
through, but i am tempted to label it as a required reading for anyone
starting in consulting.

here’s a quote from “motivational crisis” chapter:

> Are professionals different from other types of workers? Do they need
> to be managed (and motivated) in special ways? While it is difficult
> to support the assertion that all professionals are different from all
> other workers, my work has led me to suspect that, when it comes to
> motivating forces, the average professional *is* different from the
> average worker in other environments: a difference based, I suspect,
> not on such things as educational levels, but on the psyche of those
> who choose professional careers.

> The typical professional is apt to describe him or herself in the
> following way: “I am the type of person who gets bored easily. I hate
> doing repetitive sorts of work, and always like to seek out new
> challenges. Once I know I can do something, it tends not to satisfy me
> anymore.” This is, of course, a somewhat self-flattering description.
> In my experience, however, it is an accurate one. Professionals,
> certainly the best among them, are constantly driven to seek out the
> new, the unfamiliar, the challenging. The key word here is driven.

> People who feel the (neurotic?) need to constantly and repeatedly test
> their skills against unfamiliar problems with an uncertain probability
> of success are frequently insecure, with a low sense of self-worth
> (never expressed in public), in constant need of external tests of
> their merits to prove (to themselves) that they still “got it.”

> Many professionals, I would assert, are prime examples of what is now
> termed “The Impostor Syndrome”—successful people who live in constant
> dread that someone will, one day, tap them on the shoulder and say
> “We’ve found you out. You’ve been faking it all these years.”

> Because of this, professionals tend to exhibit some clearly defined
> behavioral characteristics. They require continual challenge and
> personal growth to retain their interest, and are impatient when they
> do not receive it. They constantly ask themselves, and their
> superiors, “Am I still on track?” Because of their insecurity, and the
> ambiguity that surrounds the definition of “good work” in professional
> contexts, they need quick, repeated feedback on their performance to
> validate their efforts. They tend to be “scoreboard-oriented”: eager
> for visible, well-defined measures of success that can reassure them.
> They like to have unambiguous goals to shoot at. From their need to
> achieve self-respect by receiving the respect of others, it follows
> that professionals value both autonomy in their work and involvement
> in policy decisions, whether on engagements or firm-management
> matters. As much as these “rewards” are valued in their own right,
> they are valued more as signs that the organization trusts and
> respects them.
