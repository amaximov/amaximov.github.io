    web 2.0 / communities

an acquiantance i used to share music with a few years ago recently
asked me to recommend something along the lines of
[gridlock](http://www.discogs.com/artist/Gridlock) and [bad
sector](http://www.discogs.com/artist/Bad+Sector) that he really enjoyed
back in the day.

anyone that knows these bands, would understand why it was not an easy
question to answer - the genres represented by the two are too broad,
there are hundreds of names that could fit.

i briefly considered rattling off a dozen or so names off the top of my
head, but then i remebered that we live in the time of web 2.0
(literally, as the [conference is taking place right
now](http://www.web2con.com/)), and we have
[last.fm](http://www.last.fm/) (formerly known as
[audioscrobbler](http://www.audioscrobbler.net/)).

i can attest to the fact that the resulting "listening clouds" are a
good place to start exploring similar names
([here](http://www.last.fm/explore/?artistname=gridlock) and
[here](http://www.last.fm/explore/?artistname=bad+sector)).
