here's [daily wtf](http://thedailywtf.com/ "daily wtf")-worthy quote
related to me by a co-worker.

some background: we've been helping these guys move their stuff to our
new source control.

*us:* all your stuff is set, check and make sure it's ok, then we'll
move it to the main repository  
*them:* we'll let you know when we deploy it to production  
*us:* we don't care when you deploy it. all we need from you is to
verify that your stuff looks ok in the test repository, then we will
move it to the main one  
*them:* it's ok, it will go away in just a couple of months  
*us:* oh, so you mean it is a test throwaway prototype project?  
*them:* no, it will go into production in two months, so no one will be
using a source control repository after that  
*us:* ...
