[speaking of motivation](/2007/11/15/looks-matter), [this
article](http://www.cio.com/article/print/123406) by [esther
derby](http://www.estherderby.com/) that
[muness](http://muness.blogspot.com/) pointed out to me a while ago is
quite appropriate. here’s a quote:

sadly, i’ve seen this happen over and over again.

this time with the newcomer is quite special – take advantage of it (or
cultivate it, if possible). they have a perspective and the motivation
that might disappear later. they can bring in the new ideas, point out
something you’ve never thought of, or simply challenge the status quo.
this sort of disruptive energy is very healthy and should happen on
regular basis… just *stop demotivating me!* (sorry, i could not resist –
the article title is way too catchy)
