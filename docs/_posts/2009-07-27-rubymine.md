    rubymine

[scarred, but not defeated by vim](/2009/7/24/ode-to-vi), i decided to
try a [recently released
beta](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/RUBYDEV/RubyMine+EAP)
of [rubymine 1.5](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/), and it’s been great
so far.

massive disclaimer: i have not tried anything else for ruby/rails coding
except for [vim](/2009/7/24/ode-to-vi).

unlike a [similar offering from
netbeans](http://www.netbeans.org/features/ruby/), rubymine is a
standalone install that seems to reuse a lot of the existing [intellij
idea](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) codebase.

it was great experience out of the box – i pointed it at the local svn
working copy and it verified all the installed gems (even though i am
fortunate enough to run on cygwin, it recognized them all).

it has great `rake` support, and all rake tasks run without any
modifications. however, for `script/server` in cygwin evironment i had
to replace `-e"STDOUT.sync=true;STDERR.sync=true;load($0=ARGV.shift);"`
with
`-e"STDOUT.sync=true;STDERR.sync=true;RAILS_ROOT='/cygdrive/c/project/root/dir';load($0=ARGV.shift);"`
in `ruby arguments` field. once the server runs, it also displays its
log with proper color-coding.

i still run `script/console` from cygwin command line, since rubymine
does not do `readline` support (i use `ctrl+L`, `ctrl+R`, tab
completion, `ctrl+e`/`ctrl+a` and other goodness quite a lot in my
`irb`).

##### things to love

-   color-coding, auto-indenting (including color-coding of matching
    brace/bracket/do-end block)
-   `ctrl+shift+n`/`ctrl+n` for finding files and getting around; with
    `alt+f1` to show current file in different contexts/views
-   `ctrl+f12` for current file structure
-   visible spaces (otherwise the ruby coding standards make the code
    look too squeezed to me)
-   `ctrl+click` when mousing over (jump to all kinds of things,
    including template names, css style names – all of it very nicely
    integrated)
-   `ctrl+/` for toggling comments

<!-- -->

-   rails project structure
-   parsing my stacktraces and linking them to the source code
-   autocompletion, although i do not find myself using it too much

<!-- -->

-   all the usual things that idea has – svn and git support out of the
    box (and shelving works, just like in `idea`, in case you have to
    work with svn)
-   pretty sweet diff (`ctrl+d`) that rivals tortoisesvn visual diff
-   `ctrl+shift+up/down` to move the current line
-   `ctrl+d` to clone selection
-   `shift+delete` to delete the whole line

<!-- -->

-   `ctrl+shift+f12` to go full-screen
-   `alt+number` to toggle between tool windows
-   file structure tool window (`alt+7`)
-   `alt+f7` to find usages

<!-- -->

-   `alt+shift+f10` to bring up run menu
-   `shift+f10` to run current run

<!-- -->

-   simple refactorings (introduce method, rename variable/method, etc).

<!-- -->

-   it is pretty damn stable, and occasional errors do not kill the
    <span class="caps">IDE</span>.

##### things to improve

-   unlike netbeans, it is not a full-blown ide with ruby support, so
    some things that exist in idea are missing (notably, database
    support, some of the team communication and code sharing features,
    and other bells and whistles)

<!-- -->

-   `ctrl-q` for docs is a bit wonky (frankly, i’d rather jump to
    matching place in the online api docs – it gives me context)
-   code folding fscks stuff up sometimes
-   still do not know how to jump to matching brace/do-end block
-   `svn switch` could not be found
-   `ctrl+shift+f10` to run current test (and any other ad-hoc run
    tasks) does not work on cygwin, unless you do `RAILS_ROOT` trick
    above

i have not tried all the other stuff, like haml support, cucumber
support, rspec, and rspec w/ drb.

overall feel is nice and polished – most things just work out of the box
(unlike the frankenstein monster that eclipse can be sometimes – truly a
Windows of IDEs).

i do believe in using “idiomatic” shortcuts with an <span
class="caps">IDE</span>, thus i did not try any of the “compatibility”
keyboard modes.

for now, i do not see myself coming back to vi for rails development –
for a hundred bucks, rubymine is a great development tool.
