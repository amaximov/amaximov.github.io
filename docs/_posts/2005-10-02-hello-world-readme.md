    hello world / readme
---

after about 4+ years of personal blogging, and 3 years of blog-like
posts about music, i feel that it is necessary to create a medium for my
tech posts, disconnected from my other online personalities.

a lot of the stuff that I want to place here would be notes to myself,
resources, quick memory crutches, as well as rants and raves about the
stuff I work on at the moment. hopefully this will not deteriorate into
the incessant stream of faceless links or obscure one-off notes.

this is the stuff I like, this is the stuff I do as a hobby and for
living. this blog is primarily for my own benefit, since writing for me
is the best way of exploring a topic; at the same time over the years I
realized that others' attention is the strongest motivator for
continuing to write. unfortunately this very attention becomes a
stifling force over time (at least with personal blogging) - one becomes
cautious, aware of the readers' watchful gaze.

job hunting is another selfish motivation - it is so hard to judge
someone based on a resume, and hopefully I can be open and confident
enough to have this blog serve as a professional representation.

all the usual disclaimers apply - everything here is my opinion only and
does not in any way reflect the opinions of any of my employers (past
and present).
