So here I am, taking a break from updating my resume. I must say I do
feel a subtle streak of vengeance; even though fully acknowledging the
childish nature of it.

I think past few months proved to be a good experience; they showed me
what happens if there was nothing but work in my life. Not only my world
condenses and becomes a tunnel, but even the work itself starts to
suffer as I dutifully plug away without ability to step back, look
around and get that much needed "[blow your
mind](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/08/blow_your_own_m.html)"
experience that ultimately makes me better at my daytime job.

I stopped reading, I stopped actually *listening* to music, I spent less
time on film, on my friends, even on just forgetting the work for a day.
The last drop was dreaming about work in those few hours between the
urgent phone calls.

Work is not my life, it is something I like doing, it also happens to be
my hobby, but it can only co-exist with all the other stuff I am into. I
do tend to go into these intensely focused streaks with all my hobbies,
but they last for a few weeks, and then I switch.

Working 12-14 hour days without holidays or days off for past two months
got me burned out. Occasional sprints at the end of the release are
perfectly normal, but they cannot last for more than a week or two.

I am also done with being on-call. I spent 6 years carrying a pager;
someone has to do it, but I value my free time too much to get into it
again (especially since we are not paid overtime, nor we are paid extra
for being on call).

Work seems to be calming down, but the problem is that the most I can
expect at the end is a \~1K bonus - all the sacrifices will be
forgotten. I have three weeks of vacation left and probably another two
weeks of comp time accumulated in past two months, but I know I will be
lucky even if I get to take my full vacation (and only one day gets
carried over to the next year). This particular situation is not the
first time it happened to me at this company. The higher-ups forget too
fast and move on, while their people at best get a humiliating trinket.

There is no carrot dangling in front of me in the form of a promotion or
a big bonus; no matter how little I think about [pop behaviorism that
drives popular incentive
programs](http://www.alfiekohn.org/books/pbr.htm), no matter how much I
value my peers' opinion and personal satisfaction, I also want to see
recognition for my work and see myself grow.

Another problem is that a lot of the work lately has been firefighting.
As any big company knows, the work distribution is 80/20, and we are
part of that 20 percent that gets stuff done. We found ourselves in the
middle of a shitstorm caused by a big-bang deployment, as it is
transitioning from consultants to employees and stabilizes.

There are a lot of things I have learned and learning every day, and it
is a big project with a lot of complex constantly moving parts.

However, I find that most of my time is spent managing the communication
explosion that is the result of several hundred people working in a
large organization burdened with compliance requirements among other
heavyweight bureaucracy (just ask me about our laptops). How can I work
on anything when I get 300+ emails a day?!

Paul Graham yet again phrases these obvious things very nicely in
"[Power of the Marginal](http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html)" while
talking about *anti-tests*:

It is getting better, and I am getting better at it, and there are
nuggets of value in this, but the question is whether I am willing to
spend my time and energy on defeating these tidal waves of crap in order
to get my work done and gain knowledge.

If I were to stay I would have to play the system in order to advance.
No matter how much you help your peers or their direct management across
the enterprise, my next title depends on the visibility to the
higher-ups, all of those that sit on the promotion board. This means I
need to pick something very visible, focus on it, and dazzle them with
reporting skills, generating as much noise as possible. Looking around,
very few of the folks at this level deserve the title at all (but those
that do are exceptional, and I am so glad I have them around, since I
can look up to them).

For the first time in quite some time I really do like and respect my
teammates and my manager; I think we have a fantastic team with a lot of
potential, and the future in half a year or a year looks pretty nice as
we are stabilizing the environments, gaining first-hand support and
implementation knowledge, positioning the team to be the
integration/best practices nerve center that possesses overall
understanding of data/systems, their problems/shortcomings, overall
design, and, most importantly, the actual knowledge of the way the
business works.

What I am afraid of is "boiling the frog" mode, the perpetual dangling
carrot of extra bonus, another small interesting project, yet another
short-term treat. This instant gratification masks the opportunity costs
of not leaving, and these costs are growing every day.

I value loyalty, I like the people I work with, and I know I will be
letting them down If I leave, but in the end I do not want to count on
company's loyalty when they make business decisions. I have no
illusions, and I'd rather be a professional in a slightly different
sense that pays less attention to emotional attachments and focuses on
more pragmatic things. I think I can do better given my current work
environment, my pay, and work hours, compared to other companies.

I am also a little leery of using blackmail tactics to get what I need
(threatening to quit or bringing an offer from elsewhere without an
intent to accept it). Unfortunately, this seems the only other way to
advance in this company without "playing the system".

The time is right. I feel like I need to move on, and changing jobs is
more of an excuse to try and change everything else (and this is what it
should be, really - a hobby that also pays for the means to do other
things). Now it is time to refresh some of the knowledge in preparation
for the (anti) tests that most of the interviewers subject people to :)
