[as i mentioned before](/2006/12/10/when-do-you-think), sometimes i do
need people around to be more creative, think stuff through, or simply
guard me from distractions (no matter how unintuitive this might
sound!). unfortunately, i do not see an abundance of laid-back
coffee-shops in manhattan. i also like working at friends’ places
(sometimes only because i am too lazy to clean my own!). i am not a
freelancer, but i can see how one would need to get out if working from
home full-time.

so this is a great idea. even if i cannot make it to this particular
incarnation, it is something to keep in mind.

it seems to be a bit different from the “established” co-working
([coworking.info](http://blog.coworking.info/), for instance), because
it is more personal – *our home*, not a communal place.
