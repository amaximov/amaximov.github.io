well, actually, *excitement* matters.

in particular, how do you motivate people to contribute; to write *that
dreaded documentation*, for instance?

perhaps one thing worth trying is appealing to the geeky side and giving
them(us) ~~toys~~ tools that tap into intrinsic motivations.

in my experience it turns out that if output looks pretty and is
immediately available (and especially instantly viewable by others) –
people are motivated to tinker and create. in fact, this is precisely
the stuff that made internet happen.

to reiterate – instant turn-around and aesthetically pleasing results
will take you a long way. probably somewhat related, but better worded –
[optimize for
happiness](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch10_Optimize_for_Happiness.php).

this post is brought to you by the scars and bruises acquired by yours
truly as i crawl away from a slow and beaten up
[twiki](http://twiki.org/) instance (that looks like something designed
by that stoic
[mosaic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_%28web_browser%29) folk
back in the day; man, i can hear the sound of knuckles scraping the
floor).
