title: >-
    ode to vi
---

i recently had to do a small rails project. so i did what i [usually
do](/2006/2/5/default-cygwin-terminal-and-environment) in these cases –
fired up the easiest <span class="caps">IDE</span> that runs anywhere –
vim.

now let me reminisce a bit – i’ve been using vi on and off ever since i
got my hands on linux in 1997, and i have not learned much beyond the
basics over the years. it works the same way on half a dozen unixes i’ve
used it on, as well as on cygwin and macs; even dreaded beasts like mks
toolkit provide it. it is an indispensable cross-platform tool.

it does not require much horsepower, and it fits well with the
back-to-command-line ideology of rails.

if all you are using it for is editing occasional file or two, it does
everything you need out of the box. throw in basic syntax highlighting,
auto-indenting, split windows, buffers – and you have enough to survive.

oh, did i mention the macho factor? it takes some effort to tame the
menu-less monster of an interface with a barrage of keystrokes that
appear as magic incantation to others.

vi has a peculiar physical effect – i often surprise myself when i
remember certain editing commands, but at the same time i am utterly
unable to remember them when standing behind someone, advising them what
to type – my fingers twitch, but my higher brain functions are not
firing.

curiously, this reminds me too much of some of the mainframe folks i’ve
seen, or even an occasional <span class="caps">SAP</span> jockey.
consider it a compliment – there is a lot of power in short mnemonic
commands compared to drill-down menus. yes, every powerful system must
have a command line, but it must degrade gracefully. with vi the
*discoverability* of interface is pretty much non-existent, and the
learning curve is steep.

my current theory is that the muscle memory vi creates leads to a
particular form of addiction which explains its appeal (and perhaps the
religious zeal).

when i work in a context of a project, where i constantly need to bounce
around different files, vim UI starts to break down: built-in buffers
support is inadequate. the editor needs to have a concept of a project i
am currently working on, and, ideally, the framework i use.

i know that the usual answer is *customize, customize, customize* – and
in this respect it follows very much a linux tradition – if you are
15yrs old, and have tons of time, and only one machine, you can spend
days crafting that perfect setup that is just right. having done that a
number of times, i have learned that it is just not worth my time – I
switch computers often, work on client sites, bounce between different
teams, so i want stuff that is reasonably workable out of the box.

i can take it easy and install some basic plugins – [fuzzy
finder](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1984) to give me
files i want fast, [nerd
tree](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658) for
filesystem navigation,
[rails](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1567) for rails
integration,
[tComment](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1173) for
toggling comments on blocks of text.

but now i need to manage them across several machines, and perhaps i do
not want to spoil my vi muscle memory that can cripple my vi-*fu* on
that hp-ux 11.11 when i come across it (yeah right).

so perhaps i will draw the line and use some other ide for project work,
leaving vi for simpler stuff.

to add some substance to this post, a few significant lines from my
`.vimrc`:


    syntax enable
    filetype on
    filetype plugin on

    set tabstop=4
    set shiftwidth=4
    set expandtab

    autocmd FileType ruby set shiftwidth=2|set tabstop=2|set expandtab

    set number
    set ai
    set si

and some of the commands i use often (besides the usual
navigation/editing/searching ones that are in my muscles, but refuse to
be articulated):

-   `:e!` to reload the file i am currently editing
-   `:retab` i really hate those tabs

<!-- -->

-   `:ls` to look at open buffers (the listing is a pain to read, trying
    to remember what those little symbols mean and matching numbers to
    file names)
-   `:e filename` to open a file in a new buffer
-   `:bd` to close the current buffer
-   `:e#` to bounce between two last buffers (how can i cycle between
    all the buffers ala `alt+tab`?)

<!-- -->

-   `ctrl+w` followed by `s` or `p` to start splitting windows, then
    bounce around them with double `ctrl+w` or `ctrl+w` and arrows
-   `ctrl+w` followed by `<number>+` or `<number>-` to shrink or grow
    the split windows
-   `ctrl+w` followed by `q` to close current window

<!-- -->

-   `zz` to center screen on current line, accompanied by `zt` op and
    `zb` ottom
-   `%` to jump to matching brace

<!-- -->

-   `o` and `O` to insert the line and switch to editing mode
-   `I` to insert at the beginning of the line (that i always forget,
    unlike its companion `A`)

<!-- -->

-   `m + letter` to place a named mark, `' + letter` to jump to the
    beginning of the line, `` ` + letter `` to exact position of the
    mark

<!-- -->

-   `>>` and `<<` are much easier for indenting, as opposed to my
    muscle-memorized `number + > + enter`

<!-- -->

-   `shift+v` or `v` to do visual selection
-   once you visually selected stuff, you fold it with `zf`

finally, i find the whole `:tabnew` business utterly useless and
insulting.

what i do miss in addition to project structure navigation, is easily
looking up/jumping between methods, code block folding that follows
language semantics, and decent tabs.

[entries](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2008/11/17/vim-follow-up) on the
subject were really informative and inspiring (especially the comments).
