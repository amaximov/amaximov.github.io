    contributing to projects in the enterprise
---

i really like this idea of ~~starlets~~ *grouplets* (as [used by
googlers](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2007/01/introducing-testing-on-toilet.html))
– informal gatherings of people interested in the same topic and willing
to dedicate their 20% “extra-curriculum” time to it.

they do not necessarily come from the same team (in fact most of them do
not), but they come to work on something together. for some of them it
might even become their “main” project.

there are probably half a dozen (at least) small-ish projects at work
that i would like to hack on – from an api to a commonly used tool to
some improvements to existing tools. this is the stuff that has been
created and is maintained by other groups elsewhere, but i have the
energy, the ideas, and the expertise to contribute.

the unfortunate thing is that right now it is pretty much impossible (at
least with the projects i am interested in). it is not necessarily the
direct managerial support – although it would make it easier. i think
for motivated people this support does not matter as much – most of the
stuff like that i’ve done on my own time as a skunkworks project.

i think the biggest roadblock in my case is the internal culture –
people just do not think this way. their first reaction is suspicion and
thinly veiled irritation. i understand that this is probably the result
of many incompetent people bombarding them with impatient requests, but
wouldn’t it be nice, if i simply could check out some code, tinker with
it, and then submit a patch? and have someone answer my question or two?
it would immediately help some of my daily activities, and benefit
others. sort of like the way open source projects are – scratch my own
itch and help others in the process.

perhaps, one of the first steps is to make it easier – open up source
control, do not require one to chew through the permissions/requests
muck to get access to code/environments, start an area on an internal
forum (you got one, right?) and an area in an internal wiki (you got
one, right?).

most of it will benefit you, but also allow others to come in and
contribute. in fact, most of the stuff that can be done is simply a copy
of best practices by open source projects.
