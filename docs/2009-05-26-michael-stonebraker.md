i really enjoyed [this
talk](http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4009.html) by
michael “[map reduce is
crap](http://www.databasecolumn.com/2008/01/mapreduce-a-major-step-back.html)”
[stonebraker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stonebraker). it is a
terse and mind-blowing romp through the current database landscape,
focusing on inability of one-size-fits-all “dinosaurs” to deal with
streaming data (like tick market data) as well as data warehousing. he
has some benchmark numbers and proposes some alternatives.

i have been looking into streaming databases and column data stores for
a while, but I am yet to have a production hands-on experience with
them.

i always had somewhat of an inferiority complex when it came to
databases, since these guys have done so much work decades ago that
tackled so many problems, and it seems to have had a hard time escaping
the database world and affecting CS population at large.

so this new twist in the evolutionary spiral that comes due to the
availability of cheap machines, lots of <span class="caps">RAM</span>,
and the need to process lots of data should yield interesting results. i
do hope that this will lead to a whole bunch of lean and mean
specialized solutions instead of (loosely quoting stonebraker), “here’s
oracle, what’s your problem?” approach.
