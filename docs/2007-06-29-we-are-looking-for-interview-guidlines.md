title: >-
    we are looking for (interview guidelines)
---

this is something transferred from an internal wiki; i just finished
"[professional software
development](http://stevemcconnell.com/psd.htm "professional software development")"
at the time and some of its ideas found their way into the post. granted
this is mostly talk, and the hardest part (the skill and the art!) is
actually being able to sense all of this in a conversation. usual
disclaimers - this was an architecture team for a big company, but
suspend all the negative connotations associated with the title (this by
itself is a topic for a whole post).

another disclaimer: our technical problems were not that hard at all, so
we needed someone with solid CS background *and* software engineering
background (source control, testing, builds, etc). everything else
technology-wise is easy to teach, given the right personality. which
means that in our case personality is far more important that any skills
above the basic ones.

# what we are looking for: in general

-   hands-on
-   strong current technical skills
-   solid technical foundation (CS/engineering/years of various
    hands-on)
-   wide breadth of knowledge and experience
-   ability to see direction, high-level design, and at the same time to
    be able and jump in to do development/troubleshooting. naturally
    people will be skewed one or the other way, but presence of both is
    important
-   passion - they do this stuff in their spare time, they read
    blogs/articles, they buy books, they go to conferences; they are
    excited to babble about it
-   smart (do not create busy work and slave for 24/7; ask me about
    "pray-and-rerun for 72 hrs" some time)
-   gets stuff done (ability to drive stuff to completion, not just
    fluffy ideas)
-   good match for the team culturally (openness, desire to share and
    learn)
-   self-starter - actively seek solutions, actively challenge status
    quo
-   learns fast
-   fast-paced
-   balance of
    operations/design/architecture/implementation/support/business
    knowledge
-   articulate (can explain a bigger picture for the project they've
    worked on; can explain complex concepts at high-level, easy to talk
    to, etc)

here's a little personal observation regarding the last point - past few
months i've been on both sides of the interviewing fence and it is
interesting to note that with good people the conversation just flows -
infact during some of the interviews i come up with some interesting
ideas as i am talking through things - the sparks fly, the air sizzles,
and i am truly enjoying it, no matter which side of the table i am on.
at the same time with ~~stupid~~thicker people i find myself getting
dumber and dumber - i start stuttering, repeating myself, going into
unnecessary details, eventualy getting frustrated and discouraged. i
know it is a problem of mine to an extent, but i think over the years i
have come to treat it as a rather objective indicator of how well a
person can fit in a team with me.

# what we are looking for: great designers

<img src="/assets/2007/8/27/writing_computers.jpg" data-align="right" data-hspace="10" />

-   have a list of patterns they can apply to solve problems (they've
    been around the block a few times and know a few things)
-   mastery of their toolset (they *have* a toolset, they know what to
    use when, and they actually do it)
-   seek out criticism (do not hide in the corner and spew binaries from
    time to time - they come out into the open and demand feedback)
-   strive to reduce complexity (make it as simple as possible, so that
    bugs have nowhere to hide; this is a great skill and i am fortunate
    to know a few folks that truly shine at it, cutting through layers
    of bullshit and communication problems)
-   have experience on failed projects and made a point to learn from it
    (or any mistakes - true learning does not come from the manuals that
    teach you how things are supposed to work, but from real life
    lessons that teach you when stuff does not work and why)
-   have a lot of alternatives, often wrong, but quickly correct
    themselves (a great designer should be able to generate ideas)
-   they keep trying alternatives even when others have given up - i.e.
    do not give up easily or settle with "this would do" - drive to
    completion, try other options (this is a great trait and i often
    have to kick myself to strive for it)
-   not afraid of using brute force (i.e. pragmatic)
-   creative to be able to generate numerous solutions (didn't i just
    say that above?)
-   curious (must always try to learn, figure out how things work,
    research, investigate, never settle for "someone else knows how it
    works" - always ask questions; this could be one of the single most
    important traits)
-   high energy (not sleepy, lazy - driven to get stuff done; also see
    curiosity)
-   self-confident and independent to research things that others think
    are silly, unworkable, foolish (i've been burned by this)
-   have and value their own judgment (see above) - never refer to "this
    is what someone else told me, or this is not my fault, this is what
    i have been told" but never made an effort to verify
-   restless desire to create - build things, make things work, figure
    things out, tinker
-   not satisfied to merely learn facts - but driven to apply them
    (sometimes i catch myself doing just that)
-   no lone heroes - we need those that can raise the value of a team,
    work with others, be open (share their knowledge, willing to teach,
    to educate, and to be taught and educated). *''according to many
    studies the greatest contributor to overall prductivity was team
    cohesiveness, not the individual heroes''* says mr. mcconnell (also,
    keep in mind the [*bus
    factor*](http://video.google.nl/videoplay?docid=-4216011961522818645))
-   community involvement (reading books, publications, blogs,
    magazines, attending and speaking at a conferences) - all of it is a
    sign of a commitment, treating this as a profession which does
    require life-long learning (so in the end it is merely a sign of
    professionalism, not something that is out of the ordinary); of
    course beware of talkers that do just that
-   do not fall into complacency - always strive to improve (too many
    that would not challenge themselves and others, settle down)
