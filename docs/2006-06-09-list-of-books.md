    list of books
---

Since our team at work has just been formed, we were asked to submit a
few things that we should get, one of them being a list of books. The
team does application/integration architecture and implementation. Below
is the list I came up with in half an hour, escaping work on Friday
night. A lot of these are available on Safari, but since most of these
books are technology-agnostic (i.e. not reference texts), they age well,
and therefore should reside on a bookshelf.

Probably there are a few that I am missing, especially in the non-tech
department. Some of these are also listed more for the culture shock
value, to get people thinking. Also, these are not developers' books per
se, considering that folks should have a developer background and the
nature of the group's work.
