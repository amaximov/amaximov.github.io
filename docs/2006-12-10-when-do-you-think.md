    when do you think?

i think it was
[rutherford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford "rutherford")
that upon noticing that one of his students spent all his time at the
laboratory experimenting, exclaimed, "but when do you think?"

work feels like a rat race these days, and i almost have no time to
catch up with blogosphere, let alone spend some time playing with things
that are interesting and somewhat unrelated (interestingly most of the
stuff that i am proud of at work, the stuff that is actually cool, i did
as a skunkwork project in my spare time).

i am glad to report though, that i finally found a way to listen to
podcasts. ideally it would be during commute or walks at lunch time, but
since the city is small and walking around suburban expanse of parking
lot is anything but inspiring, i had to come up with something else. it
turns out that podcasts work wonders at the gym.

my problem is that these days i get too easily distracted, so confining
myself to the tedium of a workout is the best way to focus. it used to
be like that before, where i could think through designs or really
listen to music, but i never made the leap to podcasts (or audiobooks)
until past few months.

i need this time alone, this almost meditation-like state where it is
just me and one subject/object that i am dealing with. this is the time
when i get ideas, when i am creative. as long as i complement this with
regular feedback from others, this is a perfect combination. speaking of
feedback from others - it is best to get the team to eat together; it is
amazing how well it works not just for bouncing ideas off each other,
but for the overall health of the group.

at home achieving this state of concentration is often difficult, since
at the same time there are too many distractions, and not enough
difference to be inspiring. it turns out that these moment of solitude
are most productive when offset by the din of the coffee shop, or even a
bar - this way any distraction is short-lived.

at work not having an office, or even a cubicle until recently results
in constant context-switching (or even thrashing, when operation duties
of looking after others' code clash with any design/building). so i am
trying to minimize distractions as much as i can, maximizing the time
"[in the
flow](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html "the flow")";
it starts with simple things - on my machine all the interfaces are as
ambient as possible - no popus, no sounds; but most often i work from
home if i want to get anything done.

but back to podcasts - so far i have been catching up with [jon
udell](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/ "jon udell at infoworld") and
[itconversations](http://www.itconversations.com/index.html "it conversations").
jon's stuff is always a pleasure - sometimes i rewind and replay just to
get everything, sometimes i pause and think - even if the topic itself
is not that interesting, or the interviewee is not particularly
impressive, jon always finds a way to trigger a thought, providing this
inspiring jolt of ideas and connections.

i tried a few [channel9](http://channel9.msdn.com/ "channel9") podcasts,
but they were sickeningly patronizing and so bland and boring that i
switch off in just a few minutes (i cringe easily so any kind of
off-color jovial behavior rubs me the wrong way; i can barely take the
elevator music and soothing radio-voice introductions of itconversations
as it is). now that [jon is joining channel9 at
microsoft](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/12/08.html#a1574 "jon udell going to microsoft"),
i am looking forward to their improvement.

now i just need to broaden my search and see if there are any other
podcasts worthy of interest (and i guess they do not have to be
it-specific, as long as they are spoken word).
