    social networks in large companies

i came to realize it gradually over the course of past few years, but i
could not quite articulate it until i read this passage in
"[slack](http://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0767907698)"
by tom demarco:

granted, all disclaimers apply - one has to work in a role that requires
interaction with other people to get stuff done, the organization should
be large enough, etc.

my experience confirms this - in large organizations you have to know
the right people to get stuff done. in my recent role i was fortunate
enough to get into the team where i acquired the connections in a span
of several months. then you just maintain those relationships: be
sincere, make it natural (and believe it!) - you do favors for people
because you care about the stuff they need to get done, and only
subsequently they reciprocate (perhaps i am too sensitive to this, but
it is nails-on-the-chalkboard obvious when folks are shmoozing and try
to conceal it; in which case it takes a certain charisma to get away
with it).

the reality is that in large organizations no matter what
process-improving application/organization is in place, unless you know
the people, you will struggle to get anything done. with the right
people in place the process is useful, but merely as a
documentation/fallback/cya/retrospecting device that is parallel to
actual work (disclaimer: given highly motivated, conscious, caring
people).

i've seen both ends of the spectrum with new people - folks that managed
to piss everyone off in their first few days and then were left in the
vacuum; others that were unfortunate to end up in a team that did not
proactively and eagerly grow their novice; this is why we made a point
to provide as much support as possible for our (welcome) new hires in
order for them to establish these relationships (e.g. proudly introduce
them as members of our team, bootstrap them with piles of wiki entries
that include addresses and names among other things).

ideally, of course, process will be reduced to become as effective as
possible, just like personal connections will be a benefit, but not a
requirement for getting stuff done. perhaps it is just a corporate
aberration; in any case it took me a while to actually consciously
acknowledge its importance.
