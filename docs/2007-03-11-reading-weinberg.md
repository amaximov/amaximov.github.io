I am a little concerned that this space does not see much of the
technical content in past few months. One of the main reasons is that
the stuff I spend most of my energy on (and also the area where I
currently learn the most) is organizational - everything from project
delivery to team dynamics. It is surprising how much of it is
dysfunctional, so all the reading that I have done in the past and
seemed only marginally applicable now becomes incredibly relevant,
supported by real-life examples.

One of the books I really enjoyed recently was Jerry Weinberg's
"[Becoming a Technical
Leader](http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Technical-Leader-Problem-Solving-Approach/dp/0932633021/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-5214902-4276669?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1173652576&sr=8-1 "Becoming a Technical Leader")."
Very down-to-earth and personal book that is pragmatic, relevant, and
simply rings true. Here's a couple quotes:

> So perhaps a better leadership question is this:
>
> If you had to take a trip with someone else driving, would you prefer
> a driver who
>
> 1.  has never had an accident, but would likely be indecisive if an
>     accident occured
> 2.  has had an average of one accident a week, but was very adept at
>     making decisions in emergency situations
>
> Sad to say, many people seem to prefer (2). That's why Armistice Day
> has been replaced by Veterans Day. Peace is more difficult to

> Why is it that we reward programmers who work all night to remove the
> errors they put into their programs, or managers who make drastic
> organizational changes to resolve the crises their poor management has
> created? Why not reward the programmers who design so well that they
> don't have dramatic errors, and managers whose organizations stay out
> of crisis mode?
>
> Organizing is not about solving problems, but avoiding them. Once
> you're in the throes of the problem, it's too late to do really
> effective organizing. Perhaps the biggest obstacle to effective
> organizing is *our eagerness to reward ineffective organizing.*

And another one:

> A problem-solving leader's entire orientation is toward creating an
> environment in which everyone can be solving problems, making
> decisions, and implementing those decisions, rather than personally
> solving problems, making decisions, and implementing those decisions.

This is where I probably struggle the most in my current team (for many
reasons) - giving away trust to acquire trust; in other words,
delegating (the book has a whole chapter on it).

Weinberg's "[Secrets of
Consulting](http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Consulting-Giving-Getting-Successfully/dp/0932633013/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b/103-5214902-4276669?ie=UTF8&qid=1173652576&sr=8-1 "Secrets of Consulting")"
is next (kudos to [Muness](http://muness.blogspot.com/ "Muness") for
pointing him out to me).
